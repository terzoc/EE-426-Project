# EE-426 Final Project
The purpose of this python code is to view the world as colorblind people would to help design a world that is more inclusive to those with disabilities, no matter how small.
## How to?
- Install the opencv python library with `pip3 install opencv-python`
- Then in a terminal in the same directory as `colorblind.py` run the command `python3 ./colorblind.py`
- It will then ask you what type of vision impairment you would like to simulate
- Once you make a selection a display window will open
- Press `Q` at any time in the display window
